# Probability-PDF-Vs-CDF-




# PDF (Probability Density Function):
The Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. In other words, it gives you the relative probability of a random variable falling within a specific range of values. The PDF is used for continuous random variables and is non-negative. It can help you understand the distribution of the variable and where it is more likely to take certain values. The area under the PDF curve over a certain range represents the probability of the random variable falling within that range.

# CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function):
The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives you the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value. It provides a cumulative view of the probabilities as the values of the variable increase. The CDF starts at 0 for very small values and reaches 1 for very large values. It's a way to understand the distribution in terms of accumulated probabilities. The CDF can be used for both discrete and continuous random variables.
